In beta, use at your own risk

A simple React form utility to enable easy validation with minimal dependencies and written in TypeScript.

Some key features:
- Minimal dependencies
- Built in TypeScript
- Allows for easy validation, and manual validation errors from server responses
- Using modern techniques

# Dependencies

I opted to have moment and react-datetime as the only major dependencies. I think that date selection is usually pretty important (at least for myself).

There are peer dependencies on moment, react, and react-dom.

# Why I built this

Current solutions were not meeting my needs more my style. I ended up creating much of the components I required anyways, so I decided to make a simple utility until something more main stream meeted my needs.

# Usage

Check out the demo folder, I have an example. **Better documentation to come**.
